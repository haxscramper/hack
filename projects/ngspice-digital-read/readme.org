Simulate circuit behaviour using ngspice simulation.

Allow to simulate external circuit behaviour using ngspice - ~io-pin~
subcircui provides a way to either act as voltage source or as a
probe.



* Devnotes

#+begin_src spice
  #!/usr/bin/env -vS ngspice -b

  ,* Pin

  .subckt pin 1
  .param state=0

  .if (state == 0)
  ,* TO measure voltage between ground and any point in circuit
  Rxxx 1 0 1e12 
  .elseif (state == 1)
  ,* Simulate digital read
  Vxxx 1 0 0
  ,* Simulate digital write
  .elseif (state == 2)
  Vxxx 1 0 5
  .endif

  .ends

  Xread 2 pin state=2
  Xwrite 2 pin state=0

  ,* Dummy voltage source to run simulation on
  Vdummy 0 999 5

  .control

  ,* Run simulation for a single value
  dc vdummy 5 5 5

  ,* Print all vectors
  display

  ,* Print vector with values we measured
  print v(2)

  .endc
#+end_src

** gschem

Official [[http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:gschem_symbol_creation][wiki]] gives pretty good explanation on how to create own
symbols. Another [[https://ashwith.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/creating-your-own-symbols-in-gschem/][example]] (albeit more complicated). Couple points to
note:

- to add attribute for a *symbol* press ~a a~
- To add particular directory to a library files use
  #+begin_src scheme
    (component-library 
     (build-path 
      (getenv "HOME") 
      "workspace/hack/projects/ngspice-digital-read"))
  #+end_src

  In particular I have this repository located in
  ~$HOME/workspace/hack/~ - to expand home path I used ~getenv~.
