Even thougs SVG has coordinate systemd that places origin on upper
left corner and points x, y right and downwards respectively it is
easier to work with regulard coordinate system, especially when
mapping 2d image to 3d model. All coordinates, calculations, notation
etc. in this code assumes that origin is placed on lower left corner,
starts with 0,0. X axis points right and Y axis points upwards
