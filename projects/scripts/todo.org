* General

Instead of hardcoding all configuration for all conversions it would
much easier to allow using external shell scripts for converting
things between each other. And those scripts might be reused for
different purposes too. *Or*, another possible solution would be to
integrate it with =hcheat= and use the same format for converting
things between each other. Using this approach we will achieve three
goals at once:

1. Provide non-hardcoded document conversion script
2. Have more uses for =hcheat=
3. Be able to convert everything into more presentable form in case
   someone wants to just /read/ this (for example in published form)

* Hconverter

- [ ] Rename from ~circuit~ to ~hconverter~
- [ ] Add support for generating images from latex code: full-page pdf
  or single equation (default one)

* Harchive 

Unified tool for achiving files using different command line tools and
supporting various formats.
