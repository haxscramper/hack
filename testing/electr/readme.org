Simple example of interactive DC simulation

- Create ~.sch~ file using =gschem=. I just added resistor, dc voltage
  source and ground node. NOTE: It is necessary to
  have ground node present.
- Convert schematic file to netlist using ~gnetlist -g spice-sdb -o
  <outfile.net> <infile.sch>~
- Run simulation: ~ngspice <outfile.net>~
  - ~dc v1 1 1 1~ to run dc simulation for voltage source ~v1~
    starting at $1$ volt and stopping at $1$ with step of $1$. This
    basically gives you single simulation run for $v=1$.
  - ~wrdata <simulation-result.txt> v(1)~ to write result of
    simulation into ~.txt~ file. ~v(1)~ is a _vector_ (list of
    values). To get all possible vectors you can use ~display~
