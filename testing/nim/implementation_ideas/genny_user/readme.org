- Using ~writeFiles("generated", "test")~ in empty repository causes
  compile-time error - this can be checked for when macro is evaluated.
  Creating ~generated~ directory solves the issue.
- Compilation has to be performed with ~--app:lib~ option - not mentioned
  in the readme, probably obvious though.
- Generated python bindings contain hardcoded ~"pixie"~ for library name in
  shared library paths. The issue is not present for js/nim/C targets.
  #+begin_src nim
    import genny

    proc printText() =
      echo "print text called"

    exportProcs:
      printText

    writeFiles("generated", "test")

    include generated/internal
  #+end_src
- Trying to export object with non-exported fields causes macro error in
  ~exportObjectTyped~
  #+begin_src nim
    type
      Obj = object
        field: int
  #+end_src
- Is generated C/C++ object ABI-compatible with underlying nim type? What
  happens when I try to export case object, or derived object?
- No way to configure style of the genrated bindings. For some languages
  that have more or less consistent naming policies this it not all that
  problematic, but for C++ it will become an issue eventually, since there
  is no set style.
- Consider adding more high-level IR and making it easier to create single
  entry point for the generation? Code generator can be implemented as an
  object with collection of callbacks that would be invoked when needed.
  Would make it easier for other people to implement their own binding
  generators for less common programming languages.
- Not being able to get comments from anything but procedures is
  *extremely* daunting. I don't know how long it will take to make a full
  PR for that, but what about ~import compiler/parser~ and extracting
  comments ourselves? This will take a little more time (compile-time
  increased due to second re-parsing), but currently there is no other way.
- Support closure iterators?
- Making generic ~NimSeq<T>~ available would require generation of the
  ~TNimType~ as well, /or/ exporting definition of the nim type in another
  shared library that can later be used. Other things that are
  ~{.exportc.}~-ed from ~std/system~
- There *must* be a proper IR implementation instead of loosely specified
  bunch of nimnodes that is being passed around without any validation. In
  addition, this would make it much easier to specify new backends for the
  target languages. Also to avoid copy-pasting implementation again and
  again for the same logic:
  #+begin_src nim
    let
      procName = sym.repr
      procNameSnaked = toSnakeCase(procName)
      procType = sym.getTypeInst()
      procParams = procType[0][1 .. ^1]
      procReturn = procType[0][0]
      procRaises = sym.raises()
  #+end_src
