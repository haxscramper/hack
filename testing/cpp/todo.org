** Signals slots
*** TODO write hash function for unordered_multimap and use it
*** TODO [#B] Add support for passing pointer to constant data
*** TODO [#A] Add exception handing for errors and slots data casting


** Idea

*** TODO Class for integer types that discards is clamped to the range
    This might be very helpful for ~grid_converter.cpp~ or make
    function to make bounded clamper increments: this is even more
    convinient
